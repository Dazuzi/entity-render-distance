# Runelite Entity Render Distance plugin
Draws a border around the player to mark the maximum entity render distance

The border can also be rendered on the minimap, and the border colour can be changed. It is also possible to make them only appear when in, or near, the wilderness.

Nearly 100% organic Copilot slop.
